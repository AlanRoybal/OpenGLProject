# OpenGLProject

This is my practice at learning OpenGL.

The source of my learning is from [https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL)

"Chapters" are sorted by tabs from the above website with each subtab getting its own folder with a main.cpp file respectively.

I hope to get a better understanding of computer rendering and C related languages relevant to my high education coursework.
